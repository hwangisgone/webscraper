# Don't Start Web Scraping without Doing These First

## 1. Investigate the Site
* Check out view source, inspect element, see where the data is coming from, what it is look like.
-> If the data is from API you can pull, or already in `.json` file, you can shorten your code.
* Know how the pages work and the pagination. Where is the next link? Is it in your list, or you could access it from current page by a next link?

## 2. Parse locally
Save a copy of .html or .json file to your hard drive to parse locally. This speeds up parsing and prevent you from being blocked by sending too many requests.

## 3. Write a plan
Always write pseudocode or some kind of plan to keep track of your work and focus on the right things.

## 4. Keep it simple
What is the simplest way that I can achieve that? At the end of the day all we need is some data from some websites.

## 5. Pick the right tool
Obviously, you need the tool suitable for what you are aiming for.
