###### Issue 1
**Cannot find `org.jsoup` package** 
Solved 28/4/2023 22:17
Step taken:
1. Import jsoup's `.jar` file to References Library in VSCode.
2. Move the whole project folder outside the original folder - which was filled with class notes and existed settings (which maybe the causes for the error).
3. And it works magic.
