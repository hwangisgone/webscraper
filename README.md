# Final Project: Vietnam's History
> The original project description can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dI-0LJEQR6v6rokB1idBbUu1vkbUhVn2/edit).

The entities need to be collected includes:
* Dynasties
* Historical figures (kings, queens, commanders, philosophers,...)
* Monuments - travel destinations (temples, churches,...) and historical places
* Cultural festivals & celebrations
* Historical events

Each entity will have identification, properties and needs to be linked together. 
For example, an event `Den Hung Festival` should be linked to the destination `Den Hung` and the historical figure `Hung King`.

## What do we need to build?
1. To collect data, a web scraper should be implemented. This scraper should be able to: (1) Collect data; (2) Save data to file; (3) Clean up data.
2. The user should be able to search and retrieve data, so a proper interface (either GUI or command-line prompt) should be built.
